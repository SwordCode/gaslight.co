        Picking a client side MVC framework isn't easy, and seeing a trivial
        Todo app just doesn't show how much these frameworks bring to the
        table. In this workshop, we'll dive into two popular frameworks:
        #{link_to('Backbone.js', 'http://backbonejs.org/')} and
        #{link_to('Ember', 'http://emberjs.com/')}.
      %p
        We'll cover the features of each framework and dig in with code
        examples and labs that give you a solid understanding of the strengths
        and weaknesses of each. After completing this workshop, you should be
        armed to the teeth with the knowledge you need to pick the best
        framework for your next rich client web app.
