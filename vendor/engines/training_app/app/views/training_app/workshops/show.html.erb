          <p>This 3-day intensive course will forever change the way you develop
            the front end of your web applications. For too long, many web
            developers have approached front end code as drudgery. No more! We'll
            help you build the skills to write front end code you can love every
            bit as much as your server side code.</p>

      <h4>Jasmine</h4>
      <p>Before you can even begin to write good front end code, you need to
        treat it with the same loving care as your back end code. Of course,
        this means Test (or Behavior) Driven Development, and Jasmine is the
        framework of choice here. We'll dig in and give you a thorough
        understanding of Jasmine, including:
        <ul>
          <li>Matchers</li>
          <li>Spies and Mocks</li>
          <li>Working with jQuery and the DOM</li>

      <h4>Backbone.js</h4>
      <p>Beautiful code is well organized code with a clear separation of
        concerns, and Backbone.js gives us a place for everything, with
        everything in it's place. In this part of of the course, you'll learn
        Backbone by doing. We'll gradually build a rich client web application
        (with jasmine specs of course) that gives you a chance to use all the
        pieces of Backbone.js, including:
        <ul>
          <li>Views</li>
          <li>Models</li>
          <li>Routers</li>

      <h4>CoffeeScript</h4>
      <p>This "little language that compiles into JavaScript" has a truly
        lovely syntax for exposing all the awesome that was hiding in
        javascript the whole time. We'll explore all the features that let you
        shed the noise and let the intent of your code come shining through.
        We'll cover:
        <ul>
          <li>Syntax</li>
          <li>Language features</li>
          <li>Integration with existing JS frameworks</li>

      <p>The best way to describe our approach is "Hands on". As in, your
        hands, on the keyboard, creating a fully functional, from scratch, end
        to end application using Backbone.js. Every class moves a little
        differently, but here's the general outline of what we hit on each
        day:</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="four columns">
      <h4>Day One</h4>
      <p>On the first day, we'll spend the morning with some introductory
        material, we'll start with some background about how our whole approach
        to building web apps change when we fully embrace technologies like
        Backbone. Next we'll dig into CoffeeScript and jasmine, as these are
        both key building blocks we'll use as build everythin else. Finally,
        we'll start digging into Backbone itself. We should have a few working
        views (with specs!) by the end of the day.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="four columns">
      <h4>Day Two</h4>
      <p>The second day is all about iteratively fleshing out our application.
        We'll cover all the pieces of Backbone.js: views, models, routers, in
        increasing levels of detail. By the end of this day most classes have
        full end to end persistence, with some level of error handling going
        on.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="four columns">
      <h4>Day Three</h4>
      <p>The third day finds up wrapping up the basics of our application and
        then ideally gives us time to explore more advanced topics such as
        model relationships and composite views. We also like to reserve some
        time to delve into topics that are of particular interest to the
        students attending.</p>
