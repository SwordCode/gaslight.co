            AngularJS is a ridiculously productive way to build web applications. It's quick to learn and build things with, but it's also a powerful tool with some important concepts to learn. We're going to spend one crazily action packed day building an app in AngularJS together. We'll start simple, and by the end of the day be hitting some of the more advanced features of this powerful framework.
